I made this to test my current html skills as I've been through a basic course from FCC

Through my first ever project in TOP, I learned 2 new things:
1. <em> is used for implementing italic style to text and <strong> is used for bolding text
2. when we use <a> tag to refer to a link, need to add 1 more attribute which is
rel= "noreferrer" to prevent the other website from accessing our original webpage's data
