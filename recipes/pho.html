        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p style="width: 500px;">This traditional pho recipe uses beef bones, fish sauce, star anise, and ginger to create a delicious aromatic Vietnamese broth from scratch. The flavorful broth is ladled over rice noodles and thinly sliced beef and topped with fresh garnishes.</p>
        
        <h2>Core ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Beef Soup Bones:</strong> Use the shank and knee to make the homemade bone broth.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Rice Noodles:</strong> You should be able to find dry rice noodles at most grocery stores, either in the international aisle or another pantry aisle.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Beef:</strong> This recipe calls for beef top sirloin. Make sure it's thinly sliced so the hot broth can cook it.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Fish Sauce:</strong> Fish sauce will give the pho a hint of salty, fishy flavor.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Onion:</strong> Roast the onions for an extra depth of flavor.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Spices and Seasonings:</strong> This recipe calls for ginger, star anise, and salt.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Garnishes:</strong> Garnish your pho with cilantro, green onion, Thai basil, lime, hoisin sauce, sriracha, or anything else you like.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to make Pho</h2>
        <ol>
            <li style="width: 600px">Roast the beef bones and onions until the bones are browned and the onions are soft.</li>
            <li style="width: 600px">Make the broth.</li>
            <li style="width: 600px">Soak the rice noodles for an hour. Meanwhile, bring the broth to a simmer.</li>
            <li style="width: 600px">Boil the noodles, then drain and add them to a bowl.</li>
            <li style="width: 600px">Top with sirloin, cilantro, green onion, and broth. Garnish with your desired toppings.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>How to store Pho</h2>
        <p style="width: 500px">Store broth and rice noodles separately in their own airtight containers in the fridge. They will stay fresh for up to four days. When you're ready to eat, reheat the broth on the stove and rice noodles in the microwave. Combine and enjoy.</p>

        <h2>How to freeze Pho</h2>
        <p style="width: 500px">You can only freeze the pho broth, not the rice noodles. Store completely cooled broth in airtight containers or zip-top freezer bags (frozen flat) in the freezer for up to three months. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight and reheat on the stove.</p>
